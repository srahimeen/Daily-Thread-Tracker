# Daily-Thread-Tracker
Tracks daily threads on reddit and notifies user when a daily thread has been posted

Pick a subreddit and monitor it. Whenever a thread with the preset keywords is found, a message is sent to the user informing them about the post.

Can use config.txt file to initialize keywords. Config file is set up as follows:

[0] = subreddit name
[1] = words to match
[2] = message recipient
[3] = message title
[4] = message body

Where [#] is the line number.
